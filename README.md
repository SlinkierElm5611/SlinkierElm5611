## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Engineering Physics student with a keen interest in software engineering, specifically high performance computing and accelerated computing.

I have professional work experience with CUDA, Vulkan, OpenGL, C++, Python, Angular, and AWS.

Outside of work I have experience with Rust, SIMD programming, mutltithreaded design, and machine learning algorithms.

### Why Engineering Physics?

I chose Engineering Physics because I wanted to learn the fundamentals of physics and engineering, and apply them to real-world problems. I believe that a strong foundation in physics and engineering will allow me to work on a wide range of projects, from software engineering to hardware design.

### Why Accelerated Computing?

During my studies in Engineering Physics, it involved a significant number of simulations which were scripted by the students in programs such as FlexPDE. These scripts ran very slowly, especially when the problems being scripted were perfect candidates for parallelization. I realized that I could speed up these simulations by using the GPU, and I started learning CUDA and Vulkan. I was amazed by the performance and power efficiency improvements that I could achieve with the GPU, and I decided to focus on GPU programming.

This led me to professionaly work on a cross platform, realtime video renderer using Vulkan aswell as personal GPU projects such as a realtime Mandelbrot Set renderer.

In my personal time I have also experimented with the benefits of CPU vectorization using SIMD instructions. One example of this is my attempt at the [One Billion Row Challenge](https://1brc.dev/), where I made use of both SIMD and multithreading to achieve a time of 1.3 seconds.
